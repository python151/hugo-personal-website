I've always thought the `whoami` thing is dumb because it would only actually
print your username, and a more realistic command would print the description
field. So... here we are.

I'm Emily! I'm a current student at The University of Edinburgh, where I study Computer Science and Mathematics. My main interests lie in sysadmin and infosec. I'm a CTF player and I predominantly do pwn (binary exploitation), though I sometimes venture into the realm of rev and crypto (not cryptocurrency, the fun one). In my spare time I do homelab, and am a chronic tinkerer.

Currently I'm a committee member in [SIGINT](https://sigint.mx), [Tardis](https://tardisproject.uk), and the TechSec for [CompSoc](https://comp-soc.com).
